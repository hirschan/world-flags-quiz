# World Flags Quiz ðŸŒŽ

An Android app intended for learning all the world's flags.

## Flags

For the first version of the app, flags from UN member states will be included. Source from [UN](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states).
- [X] UN member state flags (193 flags, as of 2024)

## Definitions (WIP)

Continents are defined by geographical continent.

States and territories are split into following types:

**Sovereign**
* `sovereign`
* `partly sovereign` (partially recognized state)

**Non-sovereign**
* `non-sovereign`
* `self-governing`
* `partly self-governing`
* `non-self governing` (e.g. uninhabited)
* `special municipality`
* `colony`
* `breakaway state`
* `sector` (Antarctica)

States and territories can also be divided into:
* `UN member` states/countries/territories
* `Non-UN member` states/countries/territories
